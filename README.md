_(Yes, this is from an old movie.)_

Hi, I'm Evan. I'm an Engineering Manager at [SDVI](https://sdvi.com), and a longtime frontend and JavaScript engineer. Formerly an Eng Manager at [HashiCorp](https://www.hashicorp.com) and at [Fastly](https://www.fastly.com), I've spent the past six years managing teams, and well over a decade writing rich JavaScript applications. While I've always had a passion for writing code, coaching people and helping teams do their best work is what drives me today.

I take a people-focused approach to helping teams write software and deliver features; I firmly believe the happiness of a team directly correlates to the quality of its output, and prioritizing team health above all else is an amazingly effective path to getting great results. Shocker, I know.

### When I'm Not at Work

I write video game reviews for [Saving Content](https://www.savingcontent.com), and host the site's podcast, [Quicksave](https://www.anchor.fm/quicksavepodcast) (it's on hiatus but hopefully not forever) along with the site's Editor in Chief and my dear friend [Scott Ellison II](https://mastodon.social/@hawkse). Sometimes I even PLAY video games.

I like riding my bike, and playing and watching soccer. Being outside is great in general. We should all do more of that.

I run a [coffee-focused Instagram account](https://www.instagram.com/evroweonline) where I document my coffee making process, beans that I sample, tools that I like (and review), and practice my latte art. If you like coffee you should give me a follow! (I post to this less now than I used to but ocasionally I find inspiration).
  
I love to cook, though I don't often have as much time for it as I'd like these days. I do bust out the occasional tasty meal when time allows it, though.
